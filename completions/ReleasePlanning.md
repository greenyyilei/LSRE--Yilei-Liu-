#### 1. Decide on a methodology for conducting release planning and describe it (with relevant references) 

The release planning is based on the priority selection, development effort estimates, and expected revenue to pick the requirements for the next release.[1] There are many methods for release planning, like MERTS, RAM, QUPER, PARSEQ, and REPEAT. I select MERTS(A Method for Early Requirements Triage and Selection ) to  conduct release planning. 
MERTS is a method that use product strategies for early requirements triage and is built based on the needs of the literature and industry[1]. The product strategy is shown where a company wants to go, how it will get there, and why it will be successful. To conduct a product strategy, there are five key questions that need to be answered.

Where do we want to go: The goal of this question is to set the general directions of movement and the objectives specify the specification of accomplishment. The example goal is like profit, growth, and market share.

How will we get there: This is the core of the product strategy. It addresses such as customer targets, competitive targets and different advantage. The choice of customer targets deepens on the goals and objectives selected when answering the first question. The chosen of the customer targets set the boundaries of the product strategy. Prioritizing competitors also very important for this question.

What to do: This is related to the detail programs, tactics to be used to achieve the goals.   It deals with the product, pricing, promotion, distribution, and service. The result also decides the selection of strategic drives.

Why would we be successful: This is the most important question. The answer is related to the different advantage aspect of the product and has to be clearly answered to produce a competitive product strategy.

When will we get there: Roadmap can be used to support answering this question. A roadmap can present the targets based on the time and releases. In this paper, the product-technology roadmaps will define the moving targets of the strategy.

For product management, it is important to select requirements that are consistent with the overall business objectives, product strategy, and discard others at the early stage[3].

Firstly, the goal of MERTS is to provide a clear method to deal with how to achieve a common view and understanding of product strategy. 

Second, the product manager can use MERTS-generated strategies to efficiently perform  requirements classification and requirements selection within a reasonable time[3].
There is three part of MERTS. First step is early requirements triage. It includes specify the question 1), 2), 3), assign the weights for each requirement and compare requirements. The second step is to select requirements for release. It includes specify product-technology roadmap, and estimate resources. The third step is explaining the reason why the proposed strategy will be successful. The contribution of MERTS is to help explicit discussions, conduct and report strategies, and triage the requirements.

#### 2. List and discuss at least three pros and three cons with the selected release planning method (1 page)

##### Advantage: 
1. MERTS method is highly effective and efficient[3]. 
The strategies generated by MERTS can be effectively used by product manager to perform requirements classification and selection in a reasonable amount of time[3]. This reflects the high efficiency and effectiveness of MERTS. Compare to NL format, which is the industry norms, MERTS has highly effective and efficient. In paper [3], an experiment is conducted to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of requirements triage and selection for using MERTS. It can be concluded from the experimental results that MERTS is far superior to NL format when it related to strategy formulation or to requirements classification. Compared to NL format, MERTS can draw more correct decisions. In paper[2], it can be seen that the result from MERTS, product strategies, can be used to select the right requirements to release. Since NL is the benchmark for the industry, it can be concluded that MERTS is highly efficient and effective.

2. When the user clearly understands the principles of MERTS, this method is very practical and easy to use[2]. The idea of this method is very clear and with clear steps. 

3. The advantage of MERTS is that decision making can be documented in a way that provides clear decision support for all decision makers when performing requirements classification[3]. This makes MERTS can be used by most people and with high-quality results.

##### Disadvantage： 
1. MERTS is substantially a systematic method to thinking and decision making while avoiding errors. But it also means that MERTS is more time-consuming[2][3].

2. Collecting different aspects of business goals from different stakeholders and unifying them into a consensus form is a resource-intensive process [2][3]. While at the same, this process will posing a risk to the delivery process.

3. Assigning weights to the selected factors requires a lot of discussion among the stakeholders [2]. This takes a lot of time.


#### 3. Apply it on the requirements in the LSRE-ReleasePlanningProject repository. Describe what you do, and why. (5 pages)


In the reference framework, release planning starts with the product requirements prioritization. After the prioritization, product requirements are selected that will be implemented in the next release. This can be done in multiple ways, as described in the listed literature. When the product requirements are selected, a release definition is written that is validated by different stakeholders. A business case is sent to the company board. When this has been approved by the board, a launch preparation package is constructed and sent to the stakeholders.[4] 

In this product, all the requirements are from Github’ issue tracker. The following are the requirements:

1. All access to the system must take place via the systems own user interface, i.e. access from third party products is not allowed. I want this in order to Control look and feel. Avoid security issues and compatibility problems.

2. As a user I want to have personalized view in the system, so that I am only presented with information that is relevant to me. Users in the system shall have a Personal Profile. Allow other users to find contact information. Facilitate interaction between users. 

3. As a system manager I want the product to prevent unauthorized use, so that I can control who is using the system.

4. Different classes of users shall only be able to access predefined sets of functionality -- those sets of the functionality that they have access to use.

5. The product shall provide functionality that supports a teacher (course administrator) to conduct a course, manage the course, and supports the participants in following course progress, course news, and accessing information related to the course as well as exchanging course related information.

The goal of MERTS is to provide a clear method to deal with how to achieve a common view and understanding of product strategy[3]. The products strategy is shown where a company wants to go, how it will get there, and why it will be successful. To conduct a product strategy, there are five key questions that need to be answered.

There is three part of MERTS. The first step is early requirements triage. It includes specify the question 1)Where do we want to go, 2)How will we get there, 3)What to do, assign the weights for each requirement and compare requirements. The second step is to select requirements for release. It includes specify product-technology roadmap, and estimate resources. The third step is explaining the reason why the proposed strategy will be successful. The contribution of MERTS is to help explicit discussions, conduct and report strategies, and triage the requirements.

##### Part One – Early Requirements Triage. This section creates the initial product strategy for requirements triage.

A. Specify.
In order to clarify the objectives of the product, indicating the direction of product launch from the company's mission viewpoint is very important. Therefore, it is important to answer the following strategic questions.

Where do we want to go: The goal of this question is to set the general directions of movement and the objectives specify the specification of accomplishment. In this project, to establish a complete student educational administration system. This system facilitates student learning as well as teacher release course related information. The system is fully functional and can be used by both teachers and students. The system provides a platform for teachers and students to exchange information. The price is better and with good cost performance.

How will we get there: This is the core of the product strategy. It addresses such as customer targets, competitive targets and different advantage. The choice of customer targets deepens on the goals and objectives selected when answering the first question. The chosen of the customer targets set the boundaries of the product strategy. Prioritizing competitors also very important for this question. The customer target is Swedish market currently. But it will be extended to the European market and other continents in the future. The competitors are the other student systems. The advantages of this product compared to others are the functionalities and security. 

What to do: This is related to the detail programs, tactics to be used to achieve the goals.   It deals with the product, pricing, promotion, distribution, and service. The result also decides the selection of strategic drives. In this project, first, collect requirements. Then through requirements analysis, priority them and generate the requirements need to be released in the planning.

B. Assigned weights.
The answer to the first step is assigned weights. The rule is to assign weights to each factor based on the importance of each factor, with a total weight of 100. This is the simplest and fastest priority sorting method [17]. The factors are referred to Table 1 in a paper [2]. As paper limited, I only present the detailed weight table for one requirement. The result of weight for each requirement is list following.


| Requirements No. | Weightings |
| ------------- |-------------|
| 1. Restricted Interface | 171  |
| 2. Personalize Views |  193.4 |
| 3. Secure Product |  188.6 |
| 4. Limited Views | 168.4  |
| 5. Manage and Conduct a Course | 154.3  |
| 6. Market | 176  |
| 7. Heterogeneous System Access | 195.7  |
| 8. Course Information | 149.2  |
| 9. Course Participant Administration | 142.3  |
| 10. Usable Product | 169.2  |
| 11. Quick and Easy Overview of Relevant Information | 158.3  |
| 12. Course File Archive | 183.4  |
| 13. Manage Course Participators | 142.3  |
| 14. System Users |  136.8 |
| 15. User Interface Language | 158.4  |
| 16. Course Calendar | 172.3  |
| 17. Course Links Archive | 144.5  |
| 18. Discussion Forum | 152.1  |
| 19. Product Access | 164.3  |
| 20. Login/Logout | 182.4  |
| 21. Add/Remove files to file archive | 170.2 |
| 22. Download files from Course File Archive | 172.5  |
| 23. Basic Contents of Personal Profile | 183.6  |
| 24. Access to view Social Security Number | 178.4  |
| 25. Add/Remove Participator to Course | 169.4  |

C. Compare requirements.

The weight of all requirements is compared with a threshold to select or reject each requirement.

The threshold is identified as the average of the weights for all requirements. The total is 4177. The average is 167.08. So for these requirements that weight is higher than this are selected. They are Restricted Interface, Personalize Views, Secure Product, Limited Views, Market, Heterogeneous System Access, Usable Product, Course File Archive, Course Calendar, Login/Logout, Add/Remove files to file archive, Download files from Course File Archive, Basic Contents of Personal Profile, Access to view Social Security Number, Add/Remove Participator to Course.

##### Part Two – Requirements Selection for Release 
After selected the requirements, this part is to answer “when to get there”. This part has two steps as follow.

A. Specify product-technology roadmap.

When will we get there: Roadmap can be used to support answering this question. A roadmap can present the targets based on the time and releases. In this paper, the product-technology roadmaps will define the moving targets of the strategy.

In this product, all the selected requirements are planned to release in this version. No new technologies are required and no requirements need to be postponed. 

B. Estimate resources.

To ensure the feasibility of the selected requirements, it is very important to estimate the cost and effort. There are many methods can use to estimate effort, time, and cost. For instance, function points, feature points, and COCOMO.  

##### Part Three – Strategy Rationale 

This part is to answer “Why the proposed strategy will be successful?” This is the most important question. The answer is related to the different advantage aspect of the product and has to be clearly answered to produce a competitive product strategy.

For this product, the most advantage is the function. So the requirements prioritization is very important for release planning. In the future release, more functions will be added to improve this product and to increase the market competitiveness.


#### 4. Describe your experiences from using the selected release planning method, and your experiences from using GitHub's issue tracker for working with requirements and release planning (1 page)


MERTS uses weight assessment to determine the requirements that need to be released, which is a very detailed process. While the risk of MERTS is well controlled. The efficiency and effectiveness of MERTS are very high. MERTS can make more right decisions, and it is easy to use and easy to learn. But at the same time, MERTS is a systematic approach and the application of MERTS requires a lot of time and discussion.

GitHub issue tracker can watch, and also for a single Issue to Watch or Unwatch. Each issue can be labeled, links, classification and other operations. The syntax of its editor custom markdown is very powerful and very comfortable to record. GitHub Issues makes it easy to communicate. Github supports sending the latest status of the project that you watch to you, and you can reply directly to email. The functional design is simple and practical to get started quickly, and also with good usability.
