##1. Requirements (classic/bespoke) 
####– What is a requirement?
A requirement is a singular documented physical and functional need that a particular design, product or process must be able to perform.
The functional and non-functional requirements that software development to achieve.
####– What is a good requirement? 
#####The characteristics of good requirements are variously stated by different writers. There are some generally acknowledge[1][2].

#####“A case study evaluation of the guideline-supported QUPER model for elicitation of quality requirements”
This paper present an industrial evaluation of the model. The results indicate that the quality performance model provides helpful information about quality requirements in release planning.  All subjects stated that the most difficult estimations may be more accurate by using the quality performance model. But the main challenge was difficulties to identify and specify the values for the differentiation and saturation breakpoints.
#####“Introducing support for release planning of quality requirements–an industrial evaluation of the QUPER model” 
This paper presents the first complete version of the QUPER model, including the detailed guidelines of how to apply QUPER in practice. The results point to the importance of having concrete guidelines combined with instructive examples from real practice, while it is not always obvious for a practitioner to transfer cost dependency examples into the domains that are different from the example domain.
#####“A market-driven requirements engineering process: results from an industrial process improvement programme” 
This paper present an industrial, market-driven requirements engineering process which incorporates continuous requirements elicitation and prioritisation together with expert cost estimation as a basis for release planning. There are also some challenges for REPEAT, like Overload control , Connecting fragments, Bridging the chasm between elicitation and selection, and Long-term product strategy for a diversity of market segments.
