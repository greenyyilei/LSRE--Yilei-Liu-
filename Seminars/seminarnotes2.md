###Read up on the Boston Matrix 
Boston Matrix helps the company allocate resources and is used as an analytical tool in brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis. Analysis of market performance by firms using its principles has recently called its usefulness into question.

To use the chart, analysts plot a scatter graph to rank the (or products) on the basis of their relative market shares and growth rates.

Cash cows is where a company has high market share in a slow-growing industry. These units typically generate cash in excess of the amount of cash needed to maintain the business. They are regarded as staid and boring, in a "mature" market, yet corporations value owning them due to their cash generating qualities. 

Dogs, are units with low market share in a mature, slow-growing industry. These units typically "break even", generating barely enough cash to maintain the business's market share. Though owning a break-even unit provides the social benefit of providing jobs and possible synergies that assist other business units, from an accounting point of view such a unit is worthless, not generating cash for the company. They depress a profitable company's return on assets ratio, used by many investors to judge how well a company is being managed.

Question marks are business operating in a high market growth, but having a low market share. They are a starting point for most businesses. Question marks have a potential to gain market share and become stars, and eventually cash cows when market growth slows. If question marks do not succeed in becoming a market leader, then after perhaps years of cash consumption, they will degenerate into dogs when market growth declines. Question marks must be analyzed carefully in order to determine whether they are worth the investment required to grow market share.

Stars are units with a high market share in a fast-growing industry. They are graduated question marks with a market or niche leading trajectory. Stars require high funding to fight competitions and maintain a growth rate. When industry growth slows, if they remain a niche leader or are amongst market leaders they have been able to maintain their category leadership stars become cash cows, else they become dogs due to low relative market share.

As a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either cash cows or dogs. The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as question marks, then turn into stars. Eventually the market stops growing thus the business unit becomes a cash cow. At the end of the cycle the cash cow turns into a dog.
###Weerd & Brinkkemper “Towards a reference framework for software product management” 
This paper presents the reference framework for software product management. We are convinced that the proposed reference framework for product software management is a first step to position this important industrial domain in the field of scientific research in requirements engineering and to provide a structure for an integrated body of knowledge. 

In the basic framework structure side, the basic structure of the reference framework is based upon the objects or artifacts of product management, and upon the set of stakeholders identified in the scope of work of the product manager. And then ,there are some generic internal and external stakeholders. In next section, it explain the four process areas about the reference framework for software product management. Portfolio management entails the decision making about the set of existing products, introducing new products by looking at market trends and the product development strategy, making decision about the product lifecycle, and establishing partnerships and contracts. Roadmapping is called a metaphor for planning and portraying the use of scientific and technological resources, elements and their structural relationships over a period of time. It is used for business oriented long-term planning and technology forecasting. Requirements management contains the activities of gathering, identifying, revising and organizing incoming requirements from the various stakeholders. Requirements management starts with gathering all requirements from within the company and from external stakeholders. Release planning starts with the product requirements prioritization. After the prioritization, product requirements are selected that will be implemented in the next release.
